_**Problem Overview**_

This project contains my solution to the Fiftyville mystery problem from Problem Set 7 (SQL) in CS50.

In this challenge, I investigated a fictional crime by analyzing a town database containing crime reports, interviews, bank transactions, phone calls, flight records, and more.

The objective was to determine:

The thief

The accomplice

The escape destination

using only SQL queries.

_**Objectives**_

In this problem, I practiced:

Complex SQL querying

Combining data from multiple tables

Logical reasoning and deduction

Timeline reconstruction using data

Real-world investigative analysis

_**Database Structure**_
The investigation involved multiple tables, including:

crime_scene_reports

interviews

bakery_security_logs

atm_transactions

bank_accounts

phone_calls

flights

airports

passengers

people

Each table contained clues needed to solve the mystery.

_**Investigation Process**_

Key steps included:

Examining the crime scene report

Reading witness interviews

Tracking vehicles leaving the bakery

Investigating ATM withdrawals

Analyzing phone call records

Identifying the earliest flight out of town

Cross-referencing all evidence

_**Final Results**_

After analyzing all clues:

Thief: Bruce

Accomplice: Robin

Escape Destination: New York City

After analyzing all clues:

Thief: Bruce

Accomplice: Robin

Escape Destination: New York City

**_Key Takeaways_**

This problem demonstrates how databases can be used for investigative analysis and how SQL can uncover hidden patterns in complex datasets.
