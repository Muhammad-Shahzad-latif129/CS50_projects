_**Problem Overview**_

This project contains my solution to the Songs problem from Problem Set 7 (SQL) in CS50: Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University.

The goal of this challenge is to analyze a music database using SQL queries to answer questions about songs, artists, and their relationships.

The dataset represents a simplified music streaming platform database, demonstrating how relational databases store and connect information across multiple tables.


_**Objectives**_

In this problem, I practiced:

Writing SQL queries to retrieve specific data

Filtering results using conditions

Sorting query results

Using aggregate functions

Understanding relationships between tables

Extracting insights from structured datasets


_**Database Structure**_

The database includes tables such as:

songs — information about songs

artists — details about artists

albums — album data

These tables are linked using foreign keys, allowing complex queries across related data.

_**Tasks Performed**_

The problem required writing SQL queries to:

Find songs with specific attributes

Identify artists associated with certain songs

Sort songs by popularity or duration

Analyze relationships between artists and albums

Each query demonstrates a different SQL concept.

_**Technologies Used**_

SQL (SQLite)

Relational Database Concepts

_**How to Run**_

Open a terminal.

Launch SQLite with the provided database:

**sqlite3 songs.db**

Execute queries from the solution file:

**.read queries.sql**
